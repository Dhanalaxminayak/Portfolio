## Projects
### World Wide Mortality Analysis
![Mortality Rate](/assets/img/Screenshot 2024-03-04 at 9.20.30 AM.png)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
